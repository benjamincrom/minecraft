[21:40:34] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> there's a daylight sensor block
[21:40:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> it puts out redstone current when sunlight hits it
[21:40:50] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> ah, there's the hatch
[21:41:01] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> so you get this outside
[21:41:18] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> spaaaaaaace
[21:41:24] [Server thread/INFO]: <jwhite69> teaaaaaaaaaaaam
[21:41:25] [Server thread/INFO]: [gerg_9358: Teleported gerg_9358 to jwhite69]
[21:41:34] [Server thread/INFO]: <jwhite69> space elevator?
[21:41:42] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> nope, just a beam of light
[21:41:47] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> but it changes colors XD
[21:42:13] [Server thread/INFO]: <jwhite69> doesn't the entrace change color too?
[21:42:15] [Server thread/INFO]: [gerg_9358: Teleported gerg_9358 to jwhite69]
[21:42:18] [Server thread/INFO]: <jwhite69> where do we control that?
[21:42:18] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> well
[21:42:24] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> go up inside the ceiling
[21:42:31] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> it's the colored glass that does it
[21:42:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> I thought about building this under the floor but I wasn't sure if Kim wanted to put stuff there
[21:43:04] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> ah!
[21:43:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <jwhite69> damn, ben and kim built unit tests?
[21:43:14] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> hehehe
[21:43:21] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> forgot i built this
[21:43:45] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> Used one of the clock phases for lights XD
[21:44:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> I could totally build a bigger one
[21:44:21] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> just wanted to test out the idea
[21:44:27] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> It needs a piston-based door to seal out the light
[21:44:52] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> there are a few of these 4-phase clock devices around
[21:45:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> There's a lighthouse, a clock, and a self-building house
[21:45:12] [Server thread/INFO]: <jwhite69> what does this button do?
[21:45:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> advances it by one color
[21:45:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> there's a button topside
[21:45:39] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> so it's controllable during the day and changes color at night XD
[21:45:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> er
[21:45:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> hm
[21:46:21] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> yay
[21:46:37] [Server thread/INFO]: <jwhite69> oops
[21:46:38] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> lol!
[21:46:58] [Server thread/INFO]: <jwhite69> DP?
[21:46:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> you can also toggle the sensor (it's a switch)
[21:47:03] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> lol
[21:47:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> Disco Palace
[21:47:08] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> of course
[21:47:11] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> what else would it be
[21:47:38] [Server thread/INFO]: [jwhite69: Teleported jwhite69 to gerg_9358]
[21:48:01] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> That's the palace : D
[21:48:25] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> the glowstone towers are the route home; the tunnel roughly follows them underground
[21:48:28] [Server thread/INFO]: <jwhite69> whoa this is even cooler at night!!
[21:48:39] [Server thread/INFO]: [gerg_9358: Teleported gerg_9358 to jwhite69]
[21:48:42] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> oh yeah
[21:49:17] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> If you hit Esc then click Options and click Super Secret Settings, things will happen
[21:49:28] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> you have to close & reopen the game to turn 'em off
[21:49:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> But sometimes you get the sweet color-cycling one we got yesterday, and this place looks crazy

[21:50:46] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> I thought it was random
[21:51:12] [Server thread/INFO]: <jwhite69> so what have you and Ashly been building?

[21:54:24] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> The first two don't require leaving the minecart : D
[21:55:27] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> Man, i forget how old this world is; we've been playing in it for a couple years now
[21:55:47] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> (old for a minecraft world at least)
[21:56:15] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> ah did you catch the underwater tunnel?
[21:56:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> I'm comin' in!

[21:58:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> not all the stations like multiple riders, hrm
[21:58:07] [Server thread/INFO]: <jwhite69> just a sec
[21:58:18] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> hard to test that use case XD
[21:58:44] [Server thread/INFO]: [gerg_9358: Teleported gerg_9358 to jwhite69]
