[03:20:11] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> excellent
[03:20:24] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> hey, what if I make a circle of these end portal blocks?
[03:20:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> XD
[03:20:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> loool
[03:20:39] [Server thread/INFO]: <treeling> no!

[03:25:21] [Server thread/INFO]: <treeling> my bad
[03:25:21] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> oh, did you find the beacons?
[03:25:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> lol hm, we'll have to team up on the tunnel for this one
[03:25:46] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> so Kim got lost and started building this and I had to teleport out to her and try to find my way ba
[03:25:49] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> way back
[03:25:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> yes, the beacons were great! They guided me home
[03:25:57] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> f3 was handy
[03:26:01] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> loool
[03:26:04] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> yaaaaaaaaay!
[03:26:06] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> ooo, indeed it is
[03:26:09] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> that's how you get coordinates
[03:26:13] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> yeah, it's two-bowl trip
[03:26:24] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> There is a mod that gives you waypoints, I just haven't installed it yet
[03:26:25] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> LOL
[03:26:48] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> so would you like ssh access?
[03:27:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> send me your public ssh key in the gchat
[03:27:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> or I can set you an account with a throwaway password
[03:27:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> hummm
[03:27:37] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> yeah, gonna put your password in chat
[03:27:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> All good for now
[03:27:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> oh!
[03:28:03] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> that's cool. I probably don't need it; I'm pretty sure that mod is client-side
[03:28:13] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> oh, okay
[03:28:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> It stores the waypoints in %appdata%
[03:28:18] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> let me know if you ever want it
[03:28:23] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> ahhhhhh
[03:28:25] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> Thanks : D
[03:28:31] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> I think it was Rei's Minimap
[03:28:42] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> It also gave you a minimap
[03:28:46] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> If you didn't guess that already
[03:29:39] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> Bah, it's not current with 1.8.8. A Post-It will do : D
[03:31:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> lol

[04:22:23] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> these are neat
[04:22:25] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> yeah
[04:22:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> lol spiders and all
[04:22:38] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> come explore with me!
[04:22:55] [Server thread/INFO]: [gerg_9358: Teleported gerg_9358 to bcrom]
[04:22:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> ahhh!!
[04:23:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> look at this bridge!
[04:23:19] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> ah, it loops around
[04:23:38] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> wooow
[04:23:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> this is extensive
[04:23:52] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> yes
[04:24:42] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> hmm, if it's at all colinear with the route to the main station, we could glass in some rail
[04:24:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> oooooooh!
[04:24:52] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> yes
[04:24:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> this would be awesome to ride through!
[04:25:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> This is cool : D.
[04:25:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> I still can't find the end of it
[04:25:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> put glowstone
[04:26:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> I think tunnels do run pretty much everywhere
[04:26:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> It's cool to find a bunch of bits so well-connected
[04:26:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> indeed
[04:27:06] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> Well, I must sign off for now
[04:27:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> rest well! Thanks for joining us!
