[04:23:03] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> really glad I did that instead of waiting until this afternoon : D
[04:23:39] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> Oh yeah, if you come out to Ashly's village/castle, make sure your sound is on
[04:23:46] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> (*via rail)
[04:23:46] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> yeah, I put the backup in place just two days ago, it was really lucky

[04:31:06] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> lol
[04:31:08] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> those are hard to fix
[04:31:13] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> well, minecraft hard

[04:31:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> lol a noble task
[04:31:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> it needs another block to sit on
[04:31:52] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> yaaaaaay!
[04:31:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> then you can remove it
[04:32:17] [Server thread/INFO]: [bcrom: Teleported gerg_9358 to bcrom]
[04:32:21] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> hellooooo

[04:32:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> I changed the decor a bit
[04:32:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> where are we headed?
[04:32:57] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> why would anyone want to destroy it here?
[04:33:00] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> It's paradise?
[04:33:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> Lol
[04:33:06] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> I fear for the black heart of man...

[04:33:37] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> yaaaaaaaay!
[04:33:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> awwww
[04:33:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> Also, it's awesome that this station operates in tandem mode
[04:33:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> ... er, where did you go cousin..
[04:34:02] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> I got stuck on the drop off

[04:34:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> so yeah, you can right-click to tune
[04:34:42] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> jd needs to know
[04:34:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> and you can set the delay by how far apart they are
[04:34:47] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> he does!
[04:35:04] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> lol I want to make one of the underwanter tunnels play the first phrase of "Under the Sea"
[04:35:12] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> yaaaaaay!
[04:35:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> I lack the musical knowledge though

[04:38:52] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> this is gonna be a sweet castle
[04:40:14] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> indeed
[04:40:31] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> almost htere
[04:40:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> had to reroute to give me room for the drawbridge redstone
[04:40:50] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> cool
[04:40:55] [Server thread/INFO]: [bcrom: Teleported bcrom to treeling]
[04:41:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> kim trapped a squid!

[04:41:37] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> lol;
[04:41:38] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> damn
[04:41:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> they do that
[04:41:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> ah, there's a garden island
[04:41:56] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> I built one into a house one time, he made for a sweet aquarium
[04:42:06] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> ahh!
[04:42:14] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> yeah, it sounded awesome! damn glitch.
[04:42:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> oh this is great
[04:43:03] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> I can't believe kim built this entire structure
[04:43:09] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> I always carve out a space
[04:43:20] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> yeah, or make a box
[04:44:46] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> gonna go smoke a bowl in front of the clock
[04:44:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> I really am just a tourist here at this point
[04:45:20] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> we've made it an interesting place : D
[04:45:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> allow me sir...
[04:45:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> indeed!
[04:45:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> I love that it's grown over years
[04:45:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> oh wow
[04:45:47] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> you're right
[04:46:00] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> since 2013
[04:47:24] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> this is so cool
[04:47:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> this clock
[04:47:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> very satisfying to watch
[04:47:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> Yeah, I like how the black wool turned out
[04:48:09] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> clocks are such fundamental programming constructs
[04:48:20] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> satisfying at a deep level when building things
[04:48:37] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> even more, they're an expression of the fundamental structure of binary
[04:48:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> 000,001,010,011
[04:48:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> indeed! yaaay
[04:49:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> : D
[04:49:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> hm, don't know if I like the note blocks in there or not!
[04:49:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> oh whoah, I had my volume down
[04:49:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> oh wow
[04:49:46] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> I put 'em on the "seconds" part
[04:49:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> this is like that crazy guy in the windmill in Ocarina of Time
[04:50:00] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> LOL
[04:50:00] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> oohhhhh
[04:50:13] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> can you make it play "Song of Storms"?
[04:50:21] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> oh man
[04:50:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> the place would be huge
[04:50:34] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> it is technically possible though!
[04:50:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> We should embark on a musical project with James
[04:51:14] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> hmm, I dunno, he might pick a 15-minute Rush song
[04:51:21] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> LOOOOL, yes.
[04:51:28] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> XD
[04:52:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> there
[04:52:42] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> now there are just note blocks on the minutes & hours
[04:53:27] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> ahhhh that is nice
[04:53:34] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> -ding-, the block moves
[04:54:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> Lol these three things (lighthouse, clock, & self-building house) are all powered by 4-phase clocks
[04:55:06] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> the area has a theme
[04:55:14] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> I know! I love looking for the 4-phase core of all the things
[04:55:19] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> It's like the warp core
[04:55:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> lol it is!
[04:55:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> and it will kill you!
[04:55:31] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> (if you're not in creative mode)
[04:55:58] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> hmm, it can run faster too actualy
[04:56:03] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> wow, really?
[04:56:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> this is the slowest setting
[04:56:06] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> that's hilarious
[04:56:11] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> I don't know if the other stuff could run faster
[04:56:17] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> time for some science...
[04:56:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> this is not a clock...
[04:56:48] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> great sign
[04:56:52] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> XD
[04:56:57] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> does it run faster?
[04:56:58] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> aahhhh!!!
[04:56:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> what did you do?
[04:56:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> it works!~
[04:57:14] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> see the four repeaters in the radial pattern?
[04:57:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> yes
[04:57:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> they have a delay (shown by how far along that second torch is in the slot)
[04:57:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> I just decreased the delay
[04:57:39] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> ah, nice
[04:57:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> makes sense
[04:57:49] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> huh!
[04:58:02] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> this looks better!
[04:58:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> well, this is a good time for a bowl repack XD
[04:58:51] [Server thread/INFO]: [bcrom: Teleported bcrom to gerg_9358]
