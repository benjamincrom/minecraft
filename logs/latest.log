[20:39:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> lol hey there
[20:40:03] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> hey arent you at work?
[20:40:04] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> I knew there was a reason I double-layered this : D
[20:40:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> Not right now; we had a meeting this morning and I had some stuff to get done, but my arm was-
[20:40:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> hurting so I headed home
[20:40:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> use obsidian
[20:41:02] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> I was going to go to a clinic but now that I'm back on the couch it's stopped hurting
[20:41:13] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> Ashly said to use obsidian but I like the way the smoothstone looks
[20:41:14] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> lol of course
[20:41:28] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> ahhh
[20:41:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> been down inside it yet?
[20:41:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> a little
[20:42:17] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> I tried to dig it all out so you can see it; the first one I built (was in a different world)
[20:42:20] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> was kind of a maze
[20:42:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> lol!
[20:42:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> I have a nice entrance you know...
[20:43:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> i was afriad to break something
[20:43:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> XD as long as it's cobblestone it'll come back
[20:44:04] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> I've broken a few pistons without noticing (until I see the house missing pieces outside XD)
[20:45:13] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> pulse 1 pushes the cobble out of the generator, 2 pushes the line of pistons to make a sheet
[20:45:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> 3 pushes the walls up, then 4 (outside up in the air) pushes the roof over
[20:45:52] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> stephen will love it
[20:46:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> it was fun to build
[20:46:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> oh im looking to get a webcam
[20:46:35] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> ah!
[20:46:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> nice
[20:46:58] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> was looking at a lodgetech
[20:47:19] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> Logitech mebbe?
[20:47:28] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> not sure
[20:47:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> They're pretty much the only brand I'd recommend
[20:47:52] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> A C310 or C525 would probably be perfect for y'all
[20:48:08] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> sent you the link
[20:48:11] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> We have a C920 here but with you guys' internet I don't think the HD would do you any good
[20:48:49] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> lol how did you send it
[20:48:56] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> email
[20:49:00] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> I checked text, Gmail, and Google Hangouts
[20:49:02] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> hmmm
[20:49:18] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> Ah, I actually had to click Refresh in Gmail
[20:49:37] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> Oh wow it's 720p
[20:49:38] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> nice
[20:49:52] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> well iosent it again
[20:50:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> XD I found it, problem was between couch and keyboard
[20:50:19] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> Yeah, that one is perfect
[20:50:27] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> Your machine has Windows 8 right?
[20:50:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> yes
[20:50:46] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> yay
[20:50:49] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> can i do sound and no video?
[20:50:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> lol
[20:51:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> you can do what I did and put a post-it note over the camera
[20:51:12] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> ah ok
[20:51:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> Google may have an audio-only call, I haven't tried it
[20:51:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> i have no clue. it'd be handy for stuf like tihs
[20:53:13] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> oh yeah
[20:53:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> there are voice chat things gamers use, like Ventrilo, but yeah, a Google Hangouts
[20:53:37] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> call would be zero effort and give us the same thing
[20:53:52] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> you gotta pay for vent
[20:53:58] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> really???
[20:54:04] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> it used to be free : (
[20:54:20] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> last i knew. 8 years ago.
[20:54:42] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> maybne thats bercause so many were on it
[20:55:19] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> ive got eleanor so typing with one hand
[20:55:46] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> lol nice
[20:55:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> hmm, reading their website
[20:56:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> I think it's still free to use like we did, but you have to do all the work yourself; so now they
[20:56:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> offer a web-hosting service where they (or their approved business partners) run servers-0
[20:56:39] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> for you, and you can pay for a slice of one of those for your friends to use
[20:56:52] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> AH duh, I bet Ben already has a Vent server
[20:56:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> ah ok
[20:57:04] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> This MC server is running on a cheap virtual server he rents in Germany
[20:57:10] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> (I guess it was cheapest there XD)
[20:57:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> if we can use google that's ok
[20:57:21] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> He could (and maybe already has) put a Ventrilo server on it too
[20:57:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> Lol yeah, Hangouts is still the easiest way
[20:57:48] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> i was trying to think of a way for it to be easier for us to talk on here
[20:58:21] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> oh yeah, Hangouts is it
[20:58:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> well the webcam i picked out is approved so thats what i'll get. Tayrn said hi
[20:59:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> : D yep that one gets my stamp. Our Logitech cam has been great. Hi awesome purple-haired neice!
