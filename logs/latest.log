[02:05:07] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> hey!
[02:05:23] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> How are you feeling?
[02:05:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> not too bad; they've gotten to the itching stage
[02:05:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> itching is good.
[02:05:57] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> yep
[02:06:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> I'm still waiting for the leg to heal up enough that it doesn't throb if it's not elevated
[02:06:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> it's getting there though
[02:07:02] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> I know all about that. I took a nasty spill riding my bike one time.
[02:07:24] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> how do you change it to daytime?
[02:07:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> I wrecked a few times but never going as fast
[02:07:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> ah, type this: /time set 0
[02:07:44] [Server thread/INFO]: [Buckner7882: Set the time to 0]

[02:19:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> ah: ... gimme a sec

[02:19:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> the number is the # of seconds to apply that setting for
[02:20:28] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> hope I can remember that
[02:20:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> So that'll do it for an hour (60 seconds * 60 minutes = 3600 seconds)
[02:20:45] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> ok
