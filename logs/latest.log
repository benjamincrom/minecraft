[02:05:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> not too bad; they've gotten to the itching stage
[02:05:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> itching is good.
[02:05:57] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> yep
[02:06:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> I'm still waiting for the leg to heal up enough that it doesn't throb if it's not elevated
[02:06:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> it's getting there though
[02:07:02] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> I know all about that. I took a nasty spill riding my bike one time.
[02:07:24] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> how do you change it to daytime?
[02:07:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> I wrecked a few times but never going as fast

[02:19:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> the number is the # of seconds to apply that setting for
[02:20:28] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> hope I can remember that
[02:20:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> So that'll do it for an hour (60 seconds * 60 minutes = 3600 seconds)
[02:20:45] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> ok

[03:19:10] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> would a lever be different?
[03:19:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> it was on the ship
[03:19:28] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> nope, same thing
[03:19:31] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> well
[03:19:37] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> if it did what I want a lever would continuously fire
[03:19:55] [Server thread/INFO]: [gerg_9358: Changing to clear weather]
[03:20:07] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> hehehe
[03:20:08] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> that's better
[03:20:13] [Server thread/INFO]: [gerg_9358: Set the time to 15000]
[03:20:38] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> burns the torch out though
[03:20:58] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> not sure what I did on the ship
[03:21:37] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> ahh!!
[03:21:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> did it
[03:21:58] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> well that's a neat little circuit
[03:22:12] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> looks like not matter what you got in there they all fire
[03:22:42] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> oh wow, so you can do multiple colors in one dispenser?
[03:22:50] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> lol huh, indeed you can
[03:23:00] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> ahh!!
[03:23:11] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> it picks what it does, but looking that way
[03:23:27] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> it looks like it does one of each?
[03:24:01] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> we need a button up here
[03:24:06] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> lol right

[03:25:19] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> ah you're right, it seems to pick a few
[03:25:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> well cool
[03:26:01] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> oooh those look good
[03:26:07] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> orange and white in the same star
[03:26:23] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> those were the big orange ones i did
[03:26:37] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> there's a bunch of them in the chest
[03:26:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> for the train station
[03:26:56] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> yay, we'll keep the Jolly Creeper well-armed with those
[03:27:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> ahh!! youre' right, they'll match the glass
[03:27:20] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> yep, gotta keep the theme
[03:27:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> grabbin' a few...
[03:27:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> ok
[03:27:39] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> i didn't know how many you needed
[03:27:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> oh yeah, the rail & station are done
[03:27:49] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> cook
[03:27:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> lol I'm not sure either
[03:28:19] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> the other don't get on as often, so i just want 'em to be there when they happen by XD
[03:28:31] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> *others=Ben, Kim, JD
[03:28:42] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> ah ok
[03:29:24] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> how do you get backto my place?
[03:29:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> from the underground station near Ashly's castle, head to her village
[03:29:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> there's a Y-splitter there that stops you & lets you pick between her village & your stuff
[03:30:02] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> I need to change the sign in the station actually...
[03:30:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> ah ok
[03:31:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> the first thing you see is the jolly creeper
[03:31:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> lol yeah
[03:32:01] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> I wanted you to pop out of the ground & kinda fly past the ship
[03:32:19] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> which looks really cool now : D
[03:32:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> it looks better. i need to research more
[03:33:48] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> this was the first time I've tried diagonal track in a few MC versions, it turned out pretty neat
[03:33:49] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> vines have grown more on my bath
[03:33:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> ahhh they have!
[03:34:01] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> I'm just zipping by XD
[03:35:12] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> hehe did ya like the mob filter? It turned out nice & small
[03:35:31] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> mob filter?
[03:35:39] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> it keeps zombies (or anything not in a minecart) from walking up on the track
[03:35:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> I need to light it so they don't spawn up there
[03:35:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> (it's the thing I'm standing on)
[03:35:58] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> ahhhhh good
[03:36:17] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> There's another where the track goes underground
[03:36:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> I see now
[03:36:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> not quite as compact
[03:37:14] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> you could do it with fence
[03:37:20] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> ah true
