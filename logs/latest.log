[04:23:39] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> Oh yeah, if you come out to Ashly's village/castle, make sure your sound is on
[04:23:46] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> (*via rail)

[04:31:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> lol a noble task
[04:31:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> it needs another block to sit on
[04:31:52] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> yaaaaaay!
[04:31:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> then you can remove it
[04:32:17] [Server thread/INFO]: [bcrom: Teleported gerg_9358 to bcrom]

[04:32:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> I changed the decor a bit
[04:32:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> where are we headed?
[04:32:57] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> why would anyone want to destroy it here?
[04:33:00] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> It's paradise?
[04:33:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> Lol
[04:33:06] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> I fear for the black heart of man...

[04:33:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> awwww
[04:33:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> Also, it's awesome that this station operates in tandem mode
[04:33:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> ... er, where did you go cousin..
[04:34:02] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> I got stuck on the drop off

[04:34:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> so yeah, you can right-click to tune
[04:34:42] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> jd needs to know
[04:34:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> and you can set the delay by how far apart they are
[04:34:47] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> he does!
[04:35:04] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> lol I want to make one of the underwanter tunnels play the first phrase of "Under the Sea"

[04:40:14] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> indeed
[04:40:31] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> almost htere
[04:40:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> had to reroute to give me room for the drawbridge redstone
[04:40:50] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> cool
[04:40:55] [Server thread/INFO]: [bcrom: Teleported bcrom to treeling]
[04:41:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> kim trapped a squid!

[04:41:38] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> damn
[04:41:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> they do that
[04:41:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> ah, there's a garden island
[04:41:56] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> I built one into a house one time, he made for a sweet aquarium
[04:42:06] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> ahh!
[04:42:14] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> yeah, it sounded awesome! damn glitch.
[04:42:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> oh this is great
[04:43:03] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> I can't believe kim built this entire structure
[04:43:09] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> I always carve out a space
[04:43:20] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> yeah, or make a box
[04:44:46] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> gonna go smoke a bowl in front of the clock
[04:44:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> I really am just a tourist here at this point
[04:45:20] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> we've made it an interesting place : D
[04:45:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> allow me sir...
[04:45:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> indeed!
[04:45:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> I love that it's grown over years
[04:45:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> oh wow
[04:45:47] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> you're right
[04:46:00] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> since 2013
[04:47:24] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> this is so cool
[04:47:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> this clock
[04:47:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> very satisfying to watch
[04:47:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> Yeah, I like how the black wool turned out
[04:48:09] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> clocks are such fundamental programming constructs
[04:48:20] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> satisfying at a deep level when building things
[04:48:37] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> even more, they're an expression of the fundamental structure of binary
[04:48:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> 000,001,010,011
[04:48:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> indeed! yaaay
[04:49:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> : D
[04:49:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> hm, don't know if I like the note blocks in there or not!
[04:49:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> oh whoah, I had my volume down
[04:49:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> oh wow
[04:49:46] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> I put 'em on the "seconds" part
[04:49:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> this is like that crazy guy in the windmill in Ocarina of Time
[04:50:00] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> LOL
[04:50:00] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> oohhhhh
[04:50:13] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> can you make it play "Song of Storms"?
[04:50:21] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> oh man
[04:50:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> the place would be huge
[04:50:34] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> it is technically possible though!
[04:50:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> We should embark on a musical project with James
[04:51:14] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> hmm, I dunno, he might pick a 15-minute Rush song
[04:51:21] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> LOOOOL, yes.
[04:51:28] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> XD
[04:52:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> there
[04:52:42] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> now there are just note blocks on the minutes & hours
[04:53:27] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> ahhhh that is nice
[04:53:34] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> -ding-, the block moves
[04:54:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> Lol these three things (lighthouse, clock, & self-building house) are all powered by 4-phase clocks
[04:55:06] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> the area has a theme
[04:55:14] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> I know! I love looking for the 4-phase core of all the things
[04:55:19] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> It's like the warp core
[04:55:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> lol it is!
[04:55:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> and it will kill you!
[04:55:31] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> (if you're not in creative mode)
[04:55:58] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> hmm, it can run faster too actualy
[04:56:03] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> wow, really?
[04:56:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> this is the slowest setting
[04:56:06] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> that's hilarious
[04:56:11] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> I don't know if the other stuff could run faster
[04:56:17] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> time for some science...
[04:56:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> this is not a clock...
[04:56:48] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> great sign
[04:56:52] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> XD
[04:56:57] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> does it run faster?
[04:56:58] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> aahhhh!!!
[04:56:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> what did you do?
[04:56:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> it works!~
[04:57:14] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> see the four repeaters in the radial pattern?
[04:57:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> yes
[04:57:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> they have a delay (shown by how far along that second torch is in the slot)
[04:57:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> I just decreased the delay
[04:57:39] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> ah, nice
[04:57:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> makes sense
[04:57:49] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> huh!
[04:58:02] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> this looks better!
[04:58:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> well, this is a good time for a bowl repack XD

[05:05:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> You don't have to keep the bookshelves, I just forgot that was an option for decoration
[05:05:56] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> I like 'em. Makes me look educated
[05:06:01] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> did you see the garden island?

[05:09:19] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> I like it!
[05:09:34] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> It's not bad, but you can't ride through easily
[05:10:19] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> wow, nice nether quartz ore

[05:14:09] [Server thread/INFO]: <ashlypearson> cuz who can remember that string
[05:14:17] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> lastpass can!
[05:14:20] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> actually git is perfect for this
[05:14:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> it is; there have been times I've wanted the world file
[05:14:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> we can even create branches for experiments
[05:14:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> ah, yeah!
[05:14:45] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> could have a QA and Prod minecraft server
[05:14:48] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> fork the world!
[05:15:11] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> yay I didn't break the house
[05:15:12] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> LOL
[05:15:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> want that on a shirt
[05:15:31] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> ooh, I wanna play
[05:15:37] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> haha
[05:15:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> careful
[05:15:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> it must all trigger at once
[05:15:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> or it kinda goes everywhere and breaks the generatey parts
[05:15:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> ahhh!!
[05:15:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> too much?
[05:16:28] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> kaboom
[05:16:28] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> there we go
[05:16:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> you do the honors sir :D
[05:17:00] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> yeeeeees!
[05:17:02] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> aaaaaaaahhhhhh!!!
[05:17:13] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> this is some Tony Stark shit
[05:17:19] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> lol I like this thing
[05:17:37] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> a room with no doors
[05:17:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> well, you can always make one
[05:17:45] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> it'll close itself
[05:17:46] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> I want to have this in the real world
[05:18:10] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> it's beautiful
[05:18:12] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> it only fills a block a time, so it might take a few seconds
[05:18:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> ceiling is nearly healed up
[05:18:27] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> this is like Kosh's ship
[05:18:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> ahhh!
[05:18:34] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> or the borg cube
[05:18:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> more like a borg cube
[05:18:47] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> or the replicators from Stargate!
[05:18:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> resistance is futile (as long as damage does not proceed below ground level)
[05:19:15] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> ah you can hear the new cobble sizzling
[05:19:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> wow
[05:19:24] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> wow
[05:19:31] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> I also like this thing
[05:19:52] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> it also has a buffer because of the way the pistons "clog" up
[05:20:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> I wonder if the BigBear guy tried to destroy it and got really frustrated
[05:21:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> looool
[05:21:06] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> I wish
[05:21:09] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> it was untouched
[05:21:17] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> it was off too
[05:21:27] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> I don't think he'd look at it long enough to figure out how to turn it on
[05:21:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> weirdo
[05:21:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> we must protect our world!
[05:22:02] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> yes!
[05:22:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> would you like to throw the switch?
[05:22:48] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> indeed!
[05:23:01] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> ahhh!

[05:24:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> oh?
[05:24:35] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> I could add interior walls...
[05:25:15] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> wow
[05:25:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <bcrom> this is gonna get sophisticated
[05:25:48] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> oh yay, this is really easy
[05:26:07] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> aaaaand done
