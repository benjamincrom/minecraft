[20:39:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> lol hey there
[20:40:03] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> hey arent you at work?
[20:40:04] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> I knew there was a reason I double-layered this : D
[20:40:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> Not right now; we had a meeting this morning and I had some stuff to get done, but my arm was-
[20:40:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> hurting so I headed home
[20:40:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> use obsidian
[20:41:02] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> I was going to go to a clinic but now that I'm back on the couch it's stopped hurting
[20:41:13] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> Ashly said to use obsidian but I like the way the smoothstone looks
[20:41:14] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> lol of course
[20:41:28] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> ahhh
[20:41:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> been down inside it yet?
[20:41:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> a little
[20:42:17] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> I tried to dig it all out so you can see it; the first one I built (was in a different world)
[20:42:20] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> was kind of a maze
[20:42:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> lol!
[20:42:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> I have a nice entrance you know...
[20:43:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> i was afriad to break something
[20:43:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> XD as long as it's cobblestone it'll come back
[20:44:04] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> I've broken a few pistons without noticing (until I see the house missing pieces outside XD)
[20:45:13] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> pulse 1 pushes the cobble out of the generator, 2 pushes the line of pistons to make a sheet
[20:45:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> 3 pushes the walls up, then 4 (outside up in the air) pushes the roof over
[20:45:52] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> stephen will love it
[20:46:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> it was fun to build
[20:46:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> oh im looking to get a webcam
[20:46:35] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> ah!
[20:46:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> nice
[20:46:58] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> was looking at a lodgetech
[20:47:19] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> Logitech mebbe?
[20:47:28] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> not sure
[20:47:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> They're pretty much the only brand I'd recommend
[20:47:52] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> A C310 or C525 would probably be perfect for y'all
[20:48:08] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> sent you the link
[20:48:11] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> We have a C920 here but with you guys' internet I don't think the HD would do you any good
[20:48:49] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> lol how did you send it
[20:48:56] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> email
[20:49:00] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> I checked text, Gmail, and Google Hangouts
[20:49:02] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> hmmm
[20:49:18] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> Ah, I actually had to click Refresh in Gmail
[20:49:37] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> Oh wow it's 720p
[20:49:38] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> nice
[20:49:52] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> well iosent it again
[20:50:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> XD I found it, problem was between couch and keyboard
[20:50:19] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> Yeah, that one is perfect
[20:50:27] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> Your machine has Windows 8 right?
[20:50:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> yes
[20:50:46] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> yay
[20:50:49] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> can i do sound and no video?
[20:50:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> lol
[20:51:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> you can do what I did and put a post-it note over the camera
[20:51:12] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> ah ok
[20:51:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> Google may have an audio-only call, I haven't tried it
[20:51:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> i have no clue. it'd be handy for stuf like tihs
[20:53:13] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> oh yeah
[20:53:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> there are voice chat things gamers use, like Ventrilo, but yeah, a Google Hangouts
[20:53:37] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> call would be zero effort and give us the same thing
[20:53:52] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> you gotta pay for vent
[20:53:58] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> really???
[20:54:04] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> it used to be free : (
[20:54:20] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> last i knew. 8 years ago.
[20:54:42] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> maybne thats bercause so many were on it
[20:55:19] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> ive got eleanor so typing with one hand
[20:55:46] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> lol nice
[20:55:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> hmm, reading their website
[20:56:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> I think it's still free to use like we did, but you have to do all the work yourself; so now they
[20:56:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> offer a web-hosting service where they (or their approved business partners) run servers-0
[20:56:39] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> for you, and you can pay for a slice of one of those for your friends to use
[20:56:52] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> AH duh, I bet Ben already has a Vent server
[20:56:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> ah ok
[20:57:04] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> This MC server is running on a cheap virtual server he rents in Germany
[20:57:10] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> (I guess it was cheapest there XD)
[20:57:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> if we can use google that's ok
[20:57:21] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> He could (and maybe already has) put a Ventrilo server on it too
[20:57:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> Lol yeah, Hangouts is still the easiest way
[20:57:48] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> i was trying to think of a way for it to be easier for us to talk on here
[20:58:21] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> oh yeah, Hangouts is it
[20:58:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> well the webcam i picked out is approved so thats what i'll get. Tayrn said hi
[20:59:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> : D yep that one gets my stamp. Our Logitech cam has been great. Hi awesome purple-haired neice!

[21:00:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> it looks cool!
[21:00:57] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> i love it!
[21:00:57] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> I don't know how it'll go over in school but it looks neat
[21:01:12] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> the short bit turned out really cool, you did the messy thing perfectly
[21:01:12] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> i don't either
[21:02:07] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> i was impressed with my hair cutting ability
[21:02:37] [Server thread/INFO]: [gerg_9358: Teleported gerg_9358 to Buckner7882]
[21:02:47] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> Lol we're not sure who built that floating bedroom
[21:02:56] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> This is Ashly's (other) village
[21:03:01] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> I used to have wolves running around everywhere
[21:03:06] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> *it
[21:03:19] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> Lol and "the pit" is a Borderlands 2 reference
[21:03:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> oo, ouch, I thought I put fence around that. That's probably what happened to the wolves...
[21:03:45] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> i saw something lit up. looks good
[21:05:00] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> ah I forgot we did proper streetlights
[21:05:09] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> Usually I just bury glowstone in the road
[21:05:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> i usually just strow stuff aroudn
[21:06:03] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> as long as it keeps the creepy crawlies at bay, it works XD
[21:06:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> like this one i'm looking at
[21:06:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> yeah, that's what I usually do
[21:08:25] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> im looking for a proper place for the bathes
[21:08:34] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> hummmm

[21:09:25] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> i don't think so
[21:09:31] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> It's a thing Kim (Ben's gf) built pretty far away from everything else
[21:09:46] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> There's about a kilometer (1000 blocks) between the main station and it
[21:10:04] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> if there's anywhere good to build along there, it'll be really easy for me to connect it to the-
[21:10:07] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> -minecart system
[21:10:13] [Server thread/INFO]: [gerg_9358: Teleported gerg_9358 to Buckner7882]

[21:12:12] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> yep, continue on
[21:12:28] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> i was handing out cookies
[21:12:39] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> lol minecart rides are good for that!

[21:14:00] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> ruh roh!
[21:14:07] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> ahhh!!!

[21:14:56] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> there ya go
[21:15:21] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> it's a ways away
[21:15:47] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> looks like the shaft stephen wants me to build
[21:15:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> i'll build an arrow pointing to home base (I have a minimap mod installed)
[21:16:07] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> so you know which way is home without using the minecarts
[21:16:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> if only i knew how to use it
[21:16:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> ?
[21:16:37] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> use what?
[21:16:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> the arrow
[21:16:42] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> lol
[21:17:01] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> to point out the direction
[21:17:13] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> this is it
[21:17:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> Kim's going to redo the entrance so the station is very basic
[21:17:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> well, the minecart entrance; the front entrance is amazing (you will see XD)
[21:17:57] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> oh yeah, and I built a redstone system to make the beacon light change colors at night
[21:18:38] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> ahh!!!
[21:18:39] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> what is that!
[21:18:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> haven't seen this staircase
[21:18:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> Kim's up to something...
[21:19:14] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> whaaa!!
[21:19:24] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> well this is cool
[21:19:37] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> what is up with glowstone to the sky?
[21:20:06] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> lol
[21:20:09] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> probably a Ben thing
[21:20:16] [Server thread/INFO]: [gerg_9358: Teleported gerg_9358 to Buckner7882]
[21:20:46] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> Those are his breadcrumbs to get home XD

[21:25:14] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> w00t
[21:26:12] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> that'll work for now
[21:27:00] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> so where along this could i build?
[21:27:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> ah, yeah
[21:27:11] [Server thread/INFO]: [gerg_9358: Teleported gerg_9358 to Buckner7882]
[21:27:35] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> messing with the minimap thing, just a sec...

[21:29:17] [Server thread/INFO]: [gerg_9358: Teleported Buckner7882 to gerg_9358]

[21:29:49] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> ok
[21:30:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> : D this was fun
[21:30:42] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> I think I'm gonna get off of here & do some reading though
[21:30:52] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> ok thanks for the toure
[21:31:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> Thanks for visiting! And building; this world has gotten cooler the more people have added to it
[21:31:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> I'm excited to see the bathhouse : D. Love y'all!!
[21:31:56] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> Just trying to find a location where I don't interfere
[21:32:00] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> love you
[21:32:17] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> ah, anywhere between here and home is good; there are 930 blocks from the arrow to the castle : )
[21:32:34] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> Or anywhere off that path- it's easy to have a short tunnel coming out of the main one.
[21:32:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> Anyway, I'm off!
