[21:40:34] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> there's a daylight sensor block
[21:40:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> it puts out redstone current when sunlight hits it
[21:40:50] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> ah, there's the hatch
[21:41:01] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> so you get this outside
[21:41:18] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> spaaaaaaace
[21:41:24] [Server thread/INFO]: <jwhite69> teaaaaaaaaaaaam
[21:41:25] [Server thread/INFO]: [gerg_9358: Teleported gerg_9358 to jwhite69]
[21:41:34] [Server thread/INFO]: <jwhite69> space elevator?
[21:41:42] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> nope, just a beam of light
[21:41:47] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> but it changes colors XD
[21:42:13] [Server thread/INFO]: <jwhite69> doesn't the entrace change color too?
[21:42:15] [Server thread/INFO]: [gerg_9358: Teleported gerg_9358 to jwhite69]
[21:42:18] [Server thread/INFO]: <jwhite69> where do we control that?
[21:42:18] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> well
[21:42:24] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> go up inside the ceiling
[21:42:31] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> it's the colored glass that does it
[21:42:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> I thought about building this under the floor but I wasn't sure if Kim wanted to put stuff there
[21:43:04] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> ah!
[21:43:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <jwhite69> damn, ben and kim built unit tests?
[21:43:14] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> hehehe
[21:43:21] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> forgot i built this
[21:43:45] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> Used one of the clock phases for lights XD
[21:44:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> I could totally build a bigger one
[21:44:21] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> just wanted to test out the idea
[21:44:27] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> It needs a piston-based door to seal out the light
[21:44:52] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> there are a few of these 4-phase clock devices around
[21:45:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> There's a lighthouse, a clock, and a self-building house
[21:45:12] [Server thread/INFO]: <jwhite69> what does this button do?
[21:45:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> advances it by one color
[21:45:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> there's a button topside
[21:45:39] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> so it's controllable during the day and changes color at night XD
[21:45:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> er
[21:45:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> hm
[21:46:21] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> yay
[21:46:37] [Server thread/INFO]: <jwhite69> oops
[21:46:38] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> lol!
[21:46:58] [Server thread/INFO]: <jwhite69> DP?
[21:46:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> you can also toggle the sensor (it's a switch)
[21:47:03] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> lol
[21:47:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> Disco Palace
[21:47:08] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> of course
[21:47:11] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> what else would it be
[21:47:38] [Server thread/INFO]: [jwhite69: Teleported jwhite69 to gerg_9358]
[21:48:01] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> That's the palace : D
[21:48:25] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> the glowstone towers are the route home; the tunnel roughly follows them underground
[21:48:28] [Server thread/INFO]: <jwhite69> whoa this is even cooler at night!!
[21:48:39] [Server thread/INFO]: [gerg_9358: Teleported gerg_9358 to jwhite69]

[21:54:24] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> The first two don't require leaving the minecart : D
[21:55:27] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> Man, i forget how old this world is; we've been playing in it for a couple years now
[21:55:47] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> (old for a minecraft world at least)

[22:00:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> this one has an XOR gate for the destination (there are two switches)
[22:01:45] [Server thread/INFO]: [jwhite69: Teleported jwhite69 to gerg_9358]

[22:20:07] [Server thread/INFO]: <jwhite69> you run fast
[22:20:15] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> lol damn but I roll slow\
[22:20:28] [Server thread/INFO]: <jwhite69> hahahaha
[22:20:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> weeeee
[22:20:36] [Server thread/INFO]: [treeling: Teleported treeling to jwhite69]
[22:20:56] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> to the castle!
[22:21:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> looool
[22:21:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> man
[22:21:37] [Server thread/INFO]: <treeling> oops
[22:21:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> my system doens't like multiple riders apparently
[22:21:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> lol crap
[22:22:10] [Server thread/INFO]: [treeling: Teleported treeling to jwhite69]
[22:22:27] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> looool
[22:22:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> bah
[22:22:31] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> troll doors
[22:22:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> there we go
[22:22:49] [Server thread/INFO]: <jwhite69> thanks man
[22:22:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> lol it wanted blood
[22:23:07] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> oh yeah!
[22:23:10] [Server thread/INFO]: <jwhite69> magic room!
[22:23:11] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> do you have your speakers on?
[22:23:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <jwhite69> indeed
[22:23:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> freakin' jukebox block
[22:23:46] [Server thread/INFO]: [treeling: Teleported treeling to jwhite69]
[22:23:49] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> the songs are records under the Misc tab (lava bucket)
[22:23:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> LOL
[22:23:56] [Server thread/INFO]: <jwhite69> oops
[22:23:58] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> "Fuck your music!"
[22:24:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <jwhite69> how do I play? right click?
[22:24:27] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> Oh
[22:24:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> Equip a disc
[22:24:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> then switch to it and right-click
[22:24:45] [Server thread/INFO]: <jwhite69> snack bar/
[22:24:46] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> it'll pop out the current disc and you can put one in. This song is Strad
[22:24:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> the armorer is on the other side XD
[22:25:06] [Server thread/INFO]: <jwhite69> hey greg, do you think it would be possible to build a vending machine
[22:25:10] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> hmmm
[22:25:12] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> well
[22:25:14] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> kind of
[22:25:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> there are dispenser blocks that fire whatever items are in them when trigged by restone
[22:25:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <jwhite69> can you put stuff in minecarts? like food/
[22:25:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> well
[22:25:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> there's another way to build a minecart dispenser
[22:25:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> I built one before but it relied on a bug that they fixed many versions ago
[22:26:02] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> check out the drawbridge XD
[22:26:10] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> the XOR is under the pond
[22:26:17] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> (and the power system)
[22:26:20] [Server thread/INFO]: <jwhite69> whoa way better than a drawbridge
[22:26:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> well you don't get hinges, so I had to improvise
[22:27:48] [Server thread/INFO]: [treeling: Set the time to 0]
[22:28:14] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> loool
[22:28:21] [Server thread/INFO]: <jwhite69> how do I place a door?
[22:28:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> right-click to place a block
[22:28:42] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> some things are directional
[22:28:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> you'll see what I mean
[22:28:52] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> oh
[22:28:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> click the floor
[22:28:58] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> well, right-click the floorf
[22:29:04] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> it it'll get placed on that floor block
[22:29:10] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> with orientation dependent on how you're looking at it
[22:29:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> left click=destroy, right-click=place or interact
[22:30:00] [Server thread/INFO]: <jwhite69> hey Kim what's up?
[22:30:08] [Server thread/INFO]: [jwhite69: Teleported jwhite69 to treeling]
[22:30:17] [Server thread/INFO]: <treeling> I was playing in a boat, then my boat sank.
[22:30:24] [Server thread/INFO]: <jwhite69> lol
[22:30:26] [Server thread/INFO]: [gerg_9358: Teleported gerg_9358 to jwhite69]
[22:30:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <treeling> i like that the ceiling drips from the water above.
[22:31:02] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> lol!
[22:31:12] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> ahhh, castles are nice in the rain
[22:31:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <jwhite69> whoa
[22:31:25] [Server thread/INFO]: <jwhite69> like one of those mister tents
[22:31:31] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> lol!!
[22:31:35] [Server thread/INFO]: <jwhite69> that you see in Knoxville on game days
[22:31:52] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> nah it's not yellow
[22:32:37] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> hehe
[22:32:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <jwhite69> do you have your plumbing license?
[22:32:47] [Server thread/INFO]: <jwhite69> don't think this is up to code
[22:32:49] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> loool
[22:33:08] [Server thread/INFO]: <treeling> Greg, did you stare directly down the disco beacon?
[22:33:18] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> hehehe
[22:33:28] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> I may have
[22:33:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> Have you looked at it yet?
[22:33:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <treeling> not yet
[22:33:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> hehe
[22:34:09] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> The bit above ground is pretty cool at night
[22:34:18] [Server thread/INFO]: [treeling: Teleported treeling to -699.5, 60.0, -699.5]
[22:34:39] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> yay
[22:34:54] [Server thread/INFO]: [treeling: Teleported treeling to -649.5, 100.0, -649.5]
[22:35:34] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> this is the guts of the bridge
[22:35:49] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> the purple bit is the XOR gate
[22:36:08] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> (without it one lever being on would lock the other out from turning the circuit off)
[22:36:12] [Server thread/INFO]: <jwhite69> ruh roh we have a leak in the control room
[22:36:19] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> she can take it!
[22:36:25] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> just so it doesn't get any worse
[22:36:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <jwhite69> wonder if the designers implemented short circuiting
[22:36:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> lol
[22:36:57] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> if a redstone circuit gets flooded it all gets destroyed
[22:37:03] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> the blocks pop off
[22:37:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> happened a few times building this one; the color coding makes it easier to repair though
[22:37:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> hm, what else
[22:37:46] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> oh!
[22:37:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> this thing
[22:38:10] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> hehe watch this
[22:38:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <jwhite69> self-repairing house!
[22:39:00] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> : D
[22:39:21] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> it's powered the same way as the color changer for Kim'
[22:39:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> *'s beacon
[22:39:43] [Server thread/INFO]: [gerg_9358: Changing to clear weather]
[22:39:47] [Server thread/INFO]: <jwhite69> I enjoyed the tour!
[22:39:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <jwhite69> Gotta hop off now
[22:39:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> Yaaaay
[22:40:08] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> Thanks for hopping on sir!
[22:40:10] [Server thread/INFO]: <jwhite69> I'm going to start brainstorming on a project
[22:40:17] [Server thread/INFO]: <jwhite69> later
[22:40:19] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> Ahhh it'll be awesome, I shall build a route to it
[22:40:20] [Server thread/INFO]: jwhite69 lost connection: TextComponent{text='Disconnected', siblings=[], style=Style{hasParent=false, color=null, bold=null, italic=null, underlined=null, obfuscated=null, clickEvent=null, hoverEvent=null, insertion=null}}
[22:40:20] [Server thread/INFO]: jwhite69 left the game
[22:40:20] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> Later : D
[22:43:47] [Server thread/INFO]: gerg_9358 lost connection: TextComponent{text='Disconnected', siblings=[], style=Style{hasParent=false, color=null, bold=null, italic=null, underlined=null, obfuscated=null, clickEvent=null, hoverEvent=null, insertion=null}}
[22:43:47] [Server thread/INFO]: gerg_9358 left the game
