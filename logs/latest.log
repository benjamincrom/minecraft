[00:52:18] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> I really wish my building had an elevator
[00:52:18] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> you like it?
[00:52:34] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> It's nice, I'll text ya a couple pics
[00:52:42] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> Just had to haul all my crap up the stairs XD

[00:53:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> So yeah, I was hoping I could just sit around tomorrow : )
[00:55:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> this building is awesome. There are clouds inside!
[00:55:52] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> lol wow, and it snows inside
[00:55:58] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> I am so proud of the dome!
[00:56:10] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> oh man, it and the arches turned out really pretty
[00:56:19] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> I've never tried to do a dome
[00:56:24] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> it was a lot of work!!!!!!!!
[00:56:31] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> it looks like it
[00:56:39] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> the green hair was suposse to be darker
[00:56:46] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> circles are hard enough, but changing 'em every few blocks is a bear
[00:56:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> ah, light green looks cool
[00:57:48] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> and making it meet up together!!
[00:58:42] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> i downloaded a circle chart, so that helped. but the round dome was totally aggervating
[00:58:57] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> was thinking of putting a telescope out one side
[00:59:27] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> taryn said hi
[01:00:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> if you fly up the building looks like a cross
[01:00:47] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> sorry, went AFK for a second
[01:01:00] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> got a new robe at Wal Mart, just got it out of the dryer, mmm
[01:01:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> should be nice and warm
[01:01:28] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> yyup
[01:01:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> Just forgot the dang belt
[01:01:47] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> haha, floppy on the roof
[01:02:17] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> what do you think of the telescope idea?
[01:02:28] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> oh wow, I didn't realize 3 of the 4 entrances were decorated
[01:02:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> oh yeah
[01:02:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> telescopes are always awesome
[01:02:58] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> it'd be hard to get it to look right, but you've obviously had some practice!
[01:02:58] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> was gonna do the other some kind of stain glass thing
[01:03:12] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> i emailed you the circle charts
[01:03:30] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> : D I'm interested to see what you come up with, the colored glass is really cool
[01:03:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> ah thanks, might use these for a bigger lighthouse : D
[01:04:02] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> oh did you fly above the church?
[01:04:03] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> Hmm, should I put the teleporter inside the bell...
[01:04:07] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> yeah!
[01:04:24] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> hey we could do a death star!!!!
[01:04:25] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> spotted a floppy up there
[01:04:28] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> ahhh!!!!
[01:04:31] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> you're right!
[01:04:38] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> it'd have to be pretty big
[01:04:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> What's the diamater of the bottom of the dome?
[01:04:58] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> 49 circle chart
[01:05:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> hmm
[01:05:13] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> yeah, a death star would have to be uhhh
[01:05:15] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> big
[01:05:17] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> 100?
[01:05:20] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> all of it was 49

[01:05:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> ah dang, yeah, they only go up to 64
[01:06:58] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> ahh, I found a 101
[01:07:01] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> i gotta figure out what to do with the rest of this church
[01:07:03] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> just replied back with it
[01:07:08] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> lol yeah, that's not easy
[01:07:09] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> the 101 would work
[01:07:15] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> it's a huge space
[01:07:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> i had to do a lot of cloning to make this flat space.
[01:08:01] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> but a deathstar would float

[01:41:07] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> OH
[01:41:09] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> that's what it was
[01:41:19] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> I think you might've used Activator Rail instead of Detector Rail
[01:41:23] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> it always kicks you out of the cart
[01:41:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> ooooo
[01:42:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> lol
[01:42:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> i was in a hurry
[01:44:34] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> there
[01:44:48] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> this works
[01:45:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> totally worth that sweet cathedral thing : D
[01:45:50] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> it was an accident
[01:45:57] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> it happens
[01:46:02] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> i was cloneing and put in one wrong number
[01:46:04] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> especially with coordinates
[01:46:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> lol it's easy to do
[01:46:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> all good, that was easy to fix too : D
[01:46:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> well good
[01:46:55] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> so think on this cathedral thing. i'm kinda lost
[01:47:02] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> hmmm
[01:47:08] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> ahh
[01:47:21] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> isn't one side longer than the others?
[01:47:35] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> yes but not by much
[01:47:38] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> hmmm
[01:47:40] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> weel
[01:47:50] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> the side without anything
[01:48:00] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> maybe an actual church in that end, then statues or something in the sides
[01:48:17] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> the church can have a pulpit, pews, choir area
[01:48:20] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> like saints. I can just do them like the chess
[01:48:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> and of course a crucified Steve
[01:48:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> yeah!!!
[01:48:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> we want to do gargoyles
[01:48:39] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> oooo
[01:48:42] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> yeah, those too
[01:49:00] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> gonna put them on the outside
[01:49:05] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> Sounds hard to build but they would be reeeeally cool
[01:49:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> there is a model on the xbox version i can refer to
[01:50:17] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> ah cool
[01:50:34] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> and the floor is laid out for statues
[01:50:35] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> this is what i've been aggervating you about
[01:50:57] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> they can go inside the squares (unless you end up having to build 'em bigger to get them to look-
[01:50:58] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> -right)
[01:51:14] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> they are 7x7
[01:51:20] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> I can see why! This is really cool!
[01:52:10] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> hm, these are even numbered width
[01:52:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> ah, nice
[01:52:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> that looks good
[01:53:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> i need to send you a link for those statues
