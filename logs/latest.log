[01:59:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> ahhhh!!!!
[01:59:35] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> ship in a bottle!
[01:59:47] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> whoa!
[01:59:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> what do you think? We are gonna make the ship bigger
[02:00:12] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> ah I see, you built the bottle pretty huge
[02:00:18] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> wow!
[02:00:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> had to, to encompass it all
[02:00:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> yeah
[02:00:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> you kinda have a better idea of how it'll fit now though
[02:00:45] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> we tried a shorter bottle and it looked like crap
[02:00:53] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> ahh! captain's quarters!
[02:01:00] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> looked like a mason jar
[02:01:04] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> Lol!
[02:01:10] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> Yeah, as wide as it is it would look funny short
[02:01:37] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> oh wow, it's big inside
[02:01:37] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> yep, it's no where near done. We gotta figure out how to do the neck of the bottle
[02:01:46] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> hmm, yeah
[02:01:48] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> oh!
[02:02:03] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> you could use Pait
[02:02:06] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> *Paint
[02:02:16] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> how would it do that
[02:02:21] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> count how many blocks wide the bottle is, say 50
[02:02:35] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> then open up Paint and make a 50x50 image, and use the curved line tool to draw the -
[02:02:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> it is 50
[02:02:47] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> silhouette of how you want the curve of the bottle to look
[02:03:17] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> then you can zoom in a bit (since it's 50x50 it'll be 14x normal size if fullscreened on a 720p-
[02:03:20] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> -monitor)
[02:03:29] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> i can try it
[02:03:33] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> you should be able to see the individual pixels at that point, then you just-
[02:03:37] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> build the blocks in that pattern
[02:03:56] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> wonder how fireworks would do in here?
[02:03:58] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> I"ll give it a spin real quick...
[02:04:04] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> lol funny you mention that
[02:04:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> I noticed from the ones at the main station that they don't go through objects above them
[02:04:51] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> if you put 'em in the side like in the Creeper they might bounce around!
[02:06:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> oh wow, the Paint thing totally works
[02:06:35] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> make sure you only do one side of the silhouette, then just mirror it
[02:07:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> i'll try
[02:07:50] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> it'll look nice
[02:08:04] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> i thought it was a cool idea
[02:08:13] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> now if i can just pull it off
[02:08:47] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> oh yeah, this is really neat
[02:09:08] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> how do the sails look?
[02:09:19] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> hmm
[02:09:22] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> they look good
[02:09:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> it's hard to get the effect of separate pieces of fabric
[02:09:44] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> y
[02:09:54] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> and wind blowing in them
[02:10:06] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> ah yeah
[02:10:26] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> the slant does make 'em look more billowy than the one on the Creeper
[02:10:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> I wonder
[02:10:39] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> wonder???
[02:10:48] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> so the front sail is made of 4 panels that are 4 blocks wide
[02:10:59] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> if they were an odd number you could just knock one out
[02:11:12] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> (which would look like separate sails)
[02:11:17] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> it might look funny though
[02:11:24] [Server thread/INFO]: [gerg_9358: Set the time to 0]
[02:12:56] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> hmmm, don't know if I like either of those lol
[02:13:19] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> hm, what do you think?
[02:13:35] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> i'm not sure
[02:13:41] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> same here lol
[02:14:43] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> lol
[02:14:47] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> Ashly likes both
[02:15:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> i'll ask stephen when he butters the biscuits
[02:15:47] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> hmmmm biscuits
[02:15:58] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> cheddar bay biscuits
[02:16:02] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> *mmmmm biscuits, there we go
[02:16:24] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> ahhh yum, enjoy those!
[02:16:32] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> oh we will
[02:17:06] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> well, gonna hop off & get in the shower
[02:17:10] [Server thread/INFO]: <gerg_9358> this is awesome : D
[02:17:12] [Server thread/INFO]: <Buckner7882> ok
